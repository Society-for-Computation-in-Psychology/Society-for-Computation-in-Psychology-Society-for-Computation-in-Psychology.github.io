The 52nd annual meeting of the Society for Computation in Psychology (SCiP) is pleased to announce its call for abstracts. The meeting will be held on Thursday, November 17, 2022, before the opening of the annual meeting of the Psychonomic Society. We will be holding this event in person in Boston in tandem with the [Psychonomic Society Meeting](https://www.psychonomic.org/page/2022AnnualMeeting). 
 
The theme for this year’s conference is Psychology in the Age of Technology: Implications for Philosophy, Methods, and Practice. How has psychological study changed with the advances in technology? What is our role in this change? Check out the program [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XibXISDe_kTiA3O7z3FsPJRYhTYuJ87t9JqBreXqXvM/edit?usp=sharing).
