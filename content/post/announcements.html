<h3>2022 Conference Information</h3>
<p>The 52nd annual meeting of the Society for Computation in Psychology (SCiP) is pleased to announce its call for abstracts. The meeting will be held on Thursday, November 17, 2022, before the opening of the annual meeting of the Psychonomic Society. We invite you to submit your abstract by August 1, 2022. We will be holding this event in person in Boston in tandem with the <a href="https://www.psychonomic.org/page/2022AnnualMeeting">Psychonomic Society Meeting</a>.</p>
<p>The theme for this year’s conference is Psychology in the Age of Technology: Implications for Philosophy, Methods, and Practice. How has psychological study changed with the advances in technology? What is our role in this change? We also encourage our members to share this call with others who are doing related work but who may not be regular SCiP attendees. To submit an abstract or symposium proposal, please follow the instructions on our <a href="https://forms.gle/QFDZcVc6VchgHSyw6">online submission form</a>. Please consider forwarding our conference call to folks around your department (especially if they have been unable to attend SCiP in the past). We hope to see you there!</p>
