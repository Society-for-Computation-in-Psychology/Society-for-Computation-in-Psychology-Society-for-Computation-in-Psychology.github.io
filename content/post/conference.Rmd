The theme for this year's conference is Digital Cognitive Science: Software-driven Insights into the Mind. 

### 2024 Student Award Information

First-time graduate student presenters are strongly encouraged to submit abstracts. If you are a first-time graduate student attending SCiP, and the primary presenter, you may be eligible to have your registration waived as part of the Birnbaum Scholarship for first-time graduate presenters. Please contact our Executive Director, Erin Buchanan at compinpsych@gmail.com for details.
 
The Society sponsors The Castellan Student Paper Award for the outstanding student paper. The award for the outstanding student paper will be announced after the conference. PeerJ supports early career researchers by offering free publication to the 2024 Castellan Award winner, along with an interview about their research.
