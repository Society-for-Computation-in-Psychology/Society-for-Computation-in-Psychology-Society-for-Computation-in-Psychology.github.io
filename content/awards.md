### Castellan Prize

SCiP's primary annual award is the **The John Castellan Student Paper Award** for the most outstanding student paper. Student papers on the application of computational or computerized methods to any area of psychology (theoretical, experimental, applied) are welcome. Eligibility is open to work done by a student currently enrolled in undergraduate or graduate courses, or work done as part of a course, thesis, or other student research by a person who graduated within the past year. The student must be the primary author and the presenter of the paper to be considered. The award is presented at the conference.

[The Federation of Associations in Behavioral & Brain Sciences (FABBS)](https://fabbs.org/) represents a coalition of scientific societies with a common goal of advancing our understanding of mind, brain and behavior. SCiP has been a member society of FABBS for several years. FABBS educates federal representatives and Congress on sciences of the mind, advocates for legislation and policy that enhance scientific training and resarch, and more. Because we are a FABBS society, members of SCiP get free access to {Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/bbs) (PIBBS).

FABBS organizes the [Early Career Impact Award](https://fabbs.org/honoring-our-scientists/impact-award-winners/), and each of its member societies, every few years, chooses a recipient whose research has already made a big impact at an early stage of professional development.

2019 Winner: Dr. Laura Allen

Dr. Laura Allen, University of New Hampshire

A prominent aim of Dr. Allen’s research is to investigate the higher-level cognitive skills that are required for successful text comprehension and production, as well as the ways in which performance in these domains can be enhanced through strategy instruction and training. She has conducted a number of studies to understand how individual differences in cognitive skills and knowledge relate to performance on reading comprehension and writing assessments. This research has revealed a number of characteristics of successful readers and writers, such as their ability to generate inferences, their knowledge of vocabulary, and their ability to flexibly adapt their language across multiple tasks. Dr. Allen has drawn upon the findings from these studies to examine the impact of manipulating task instructions on task performance and to explore how educational technologies can be leveraged to facilitate learning. Laura has published approximately 80 peer reviewed publications, including 29 as first author, since 2013 -- a short and impressively productive career to date!

Dr. Allen recently received (as Co-PI) two four-year grants from the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) totalling approximately $1.4 million each. The purpose of these grants is to investigate how students process complex information in today’s technology-driven society and to develop educational tools that provide students, teachers, and researchers with writing analytics and feedback.
